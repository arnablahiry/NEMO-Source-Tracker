"""Flow-guided source tracker for per-channel wavelet detections.

Takes the list of per-channel detections produced by
``wavelet_detections.detect_cube_per_channel`` and runs a four-stage pipeline:

Stage 1 — Masked optical flow
    TV-L1 flow is computed between every consecutive channel pair, but only
    inside the intersection of the two channels' union footprint masks.
    Zeroing the images outside detected sources prevents artefact-level flow
    vectors from leaking into the tracking step.

Stage 2 — Track linking with split/merge detection
    Each active track's last centroid is propagated forward through the flow
    field via bilinear interpolation to predict its position in the next
    channel.  Hungarian assignment (optimal bipartite matching) then links
    predictions to actual detections within MAX_LINK_DIST pixels.

    Unmatched detections are classified by proximity to a predicted position:
    - Within MAX_SPLIT_DIST px → flagged as a **split** of the nearest parent.
    - Beyond MAX_SPLIT_DIST px → new independent source track.

    Unmatched predictions are classified by proximity to an already-claimed
    detection:
    - Within MAX_LINK_DIST px of a matched detection → flagged as a **merge**
      into that detection's track; centroid extrapolated via flow.
    - Otherwise → centroid extrapolated via flow (gap in detection coverage).

Stage 3 — Kinematic classification
    A track is **kinematically active** if its cumulative centroid displacement
    across channels exceeds MIN_DISPLACEMENT pixels, or if it was involved in
    a split or merge event.

Stage 4 — Source grouping
    Tracks connected by split_from / merge_into relationships are grouped into
    **sources** via union-find.  A source represents one physical object whose
    emission footprint may split into several blobs across channels (due to
    kinematics / Doppler shear) and later rejoin.

    channels, the two blobs may not overlap at all.  With an intersection

    """Link per-channel blob detections into multi-channel tracks.

    Uses stateful ghost masks and pixel-overlap matching — no Euclidean distance.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Each track maintains a *ghost mask*: its most recently known wavelet
    footprint, advected channel-by-channel through the flow via Catmull-Rom
    cubic interpolation.  Matching and split attribution both use pixel-overlap
    between the advected ghost mask and new blob masks; Euclidean distance is
    never used.

    For each consecutive channel pair (ref → tgt):

    A. Advect every active track's ghost mask through the flow → adv_maps.
    B. Hungarian matching on negative-overlap cost matrix.  Pairs with overlap
       ≥ min_match_overlap are matched; ghost reset to the matched detection mask.
    B2. Centroid-distance fallback for gap bridging.  Tracks still unmatched
       after B are flow-extrapolated one step; if the extrapolated centroid
       lands within max_gap_dist px of an unmatched detection, the pair is
       accepted as a continuation (same track, no new split edge).
    C. Unmatched predictions: check for merge via overlap, then freeze ghost
       and extrapolate centroid; deactivate if gap exceeds max_gap_channels.
    D. Unmatched detections: attributed as splits of the track whose advected
       ghost has the highest overlap ≥ min_split_overlap.  No distance fallback.
       Blobs with zero overlap to any source start a new independent track.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detections :
        Per-channel detection results in channel order.
    flow_seq :
        Output of :func:`compute_flow_sequence`.
    min_match_overlap :
        Minimum pixel overlap (advected ghost ∩ blob mask) to accept a
        continuation match.
    min_split_overlap :
        Minimum pixel overlap to attribute an unmatched detection as a split
        of an existing source.
    max_gap_dist :
        Maximum flow-extrapolated centroid distance (px) used in the B2
        centroid-fallback step.  Lets a source that drops out for a few
        channels re-attach to its original track when it reappears nearby,
        even if the ghost mask has become too diffuse for overlap matching.
    max_gap_channels :
        Maximum number of consecutive unmatched channels before a track is
        deactivated.  Prevents a frozen ghost from absorbing a spatially
        coincident but spectrally distinct source that appears later.

    """Classify sources as real detections or false positives.

    Uses two complementary metrics computed from wavelet coefficients and
    optical flow:

    - **flow_iou**: advect each source's footprint through the flow field
      (backward warp) and measure IoU with the next channel's footprint.
      Real sources follow the flow and score high; artefacts don't move
      coherently and score low.
    - **wav_abrupt**: ratio of the edge wavelet flux (first or last channel
      of the detection) to the peak flux.  Step-function artefacts that
      appear or disappear abruptly score ≈ 1; real sources fade in/out
      and score lower.

    A source is classified as a false detection if:

    wav_scale_idx :
        0-based wavelet scale index to use for spectral profile extraction.
        Should match ``use_scale - 1`` used in :func:`run_flow_tracker`.
    wav_abrupt_thresh, flow_iou_thresh, short_det_max :
        Classification thresholds (see above).
    verbose :
        Print a formatted table of sources and false detections.
    plot :
        Render and save the two-panel separation figure
        (IoU scatter + normalised wavelet profiles).  Requires
        ``vel_array`` and ``results_dir``.
    vel_array :
        1-D velocity array aligned with cube channels (km/s).  Required
